# MementoPattern
The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to capture and externalize the internal state of an object without exposing its internal structure. This allows you to save the object's state at a specific point in time and restore it later, effectively providing the ability to undo or roll back changes made to the object.
